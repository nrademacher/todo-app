## Todo app

A basic todo app in React which makes use of `useRef` and `useState` to manage different sets of state in unmounted components (all, active, and completed todos in separate tabs).

### Features

* Add new todos and manage them in All, Active, and Completed views
* Toggle between all states
* Delete completed todos individually or all at once
* Session is persisted through local storage
